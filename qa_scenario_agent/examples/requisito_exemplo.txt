Display a success popup after order submission informing that orders are being created in SAP and that order IDs will be emailed.


Descrição

As a customer, I want to see a success message after submitting orders, so that I know my order is being processed and that I will receive order IDs by email.

Details
After submitting orders, customers need immediate confirmation that the action was successful. A clear success message reassures users that the system has received their orders and is processing them. This feedback loop is essential for building trust and preventing repeated submissions. Additionally, informing the customer that order IDs will be sent via email helps set expectations and supports a seamless post-submission experience.

The success message should be displayed only after the system has validated the data, successfully submitted the orders, and confirmed SAP integration. 

Expected Benefits
Confirms successful submission and prevents user confusion

Enhances trust and transparency in the order process

Reduces support inquiries by setting clear expectations

Improves user experience with timely feedback and guidance
